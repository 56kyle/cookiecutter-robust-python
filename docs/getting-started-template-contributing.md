# Getting Started: Contributing to the Template

This section is for contributors looking to work on the `cookiecutter-robust-python` template source code itself. If you are **using** a project generated by the template, please refer to the documentation _within your generated project's_ `docs/` directory (typically accessible via `uvx nox -s docs` in your project root, or via the project's online documentation).

## Prerequisites

To contribute to the template, you will need:

1.  **Git**: For version control.
2.  **Python 3.9+**: We recommend using a supported Python version.
3.  **uv**: Our chosen dependency manager (see [Dependency Management (02)](topics/02_dependency-management.md)). Install `uv` globally or in a base environment following the official [uv installation guide](uv-install-documentation).
4.  **Docker or Podman**: Required for testing the containerization aspects of the generated template (see [Container Build (11)](topics/11_container-build.md), [Dev Containers (17)](topics/17_dev-containers.md)).
5.  **Task Automation Tools**: The template itself uses a `noxfile.py` to manage its own development and documentation build workflows. Install `nox`:
    ```bash
    uv add nox # Ensure you have uv first
    ```

## Setting up Your Development Environment

1.  **Clone the Template Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/56kyle/cookiecutter-robust-python.git # **UPDATE WITH TEMPLATE REPO URL**
    cd cookiecutter-robust-python
    ```

2.  **Install Template Development Dependencies:**
    The template needs dependencies to run its tests, build its documentation, and check its own code.

    ```bash
    uv sync # This installs deps from the template's pyproject.toml into a .venv
    ```

3.  **Install Pre-commit Hooks for the Template:**
    To ensure your contributions meet the template's own code quality standards, install the pre-commit hooks for _this template repository_:

    ```bash
    uvx nox -s pre-commit -- install # Installs hooks based on the template's .pre-commit-config.yaml
    ```

4.  **Set up Dev Container (Optional):**
    If you use VS Code and Docker/Podman, you can open the template repository in a Dev Container for a consistent environment for working _on the template_. (Add instructions here if the template _source_ also has a `.devcontainer` config).

## Running Template Checks and Builds

The template's own `noxfile.py` defines tasks for maintaining the template itself.

1.  **List Available Tasks:**

    ```bash
    uvx nox -l
    ```

2.  **Run Core Template Checks:**
    This includes linting the template's own Python files (like `noxfile.py`), checking formatting, etc.

    ```bash
    uvx nox -s check # Runs the template's internal checks
    ```

3.  **Build Template Documentation:**
    This builds the documentation you are currently reading.

    ```bash
    uvx nox -s docs # Builds the template's sphinx documentation
    ```

4.  **Run Template Tests:**
    (Assuming the template itself has tests, e.g., testing cookiecutter rendering or noxfile sessions).

    ```bash
    uvx nox -s test # Runs tests for the template itself
    ```

5.  **Run All Checks and Tests:**
    ```bash
    uvx nox # Runs the default sessions defined in noxfile.py (often check and test)
    ```

## Updating Template Version and Releasing

This template uses Calendar Versioning (YYYY.MM.DD) for its own releases.

1.  **Ensure Your Branch is Up-to-date:** Pull the latest changes from the main branch.
2.  **Run Commitizen Bump for the Template:** (Assuming Commitizen is used for template versioning). Use `uvx` to run Commitizen against the template:
    ```bash
    uvx cz bump --changelog # Follow prompts, generates tag/changelog entry
    # Alternatively, specify increment e.g., uvx cz bump --changelog --increment major_version_zero
    ```
    This will update the version string(s) (e.g., in `__version__.py` or `conf.py`), create a Git tag, and potentially update the changelog.
3.  **Push Changes and Tags:** Push the commits and the newly created tag to the template repository:
    ```bash
    git push origin HEAD --tags
    ```
    This pushed tag may trigger CI/CD for the template itself (e.g., building and deploying the template documentation, maybe running tests on the template's functionality).

## How to Contribute

(Add detailed guidelines on submitting Pull Requests, coding standards for template source code, communication channels, etc. Link to CONTRIBUTING.md if available).
