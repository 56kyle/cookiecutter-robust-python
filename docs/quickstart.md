# Quickstart

This guide provides the absolute minimum steps to get up and running with a project generated by `cookiecutter-robust-python`. It's for developers who want to start coding and use the core workflows right away.

For detailed explanations of the tools and the philosophy, see the full documentation.

---

## 1. Prerequisites

Make sure you have these installed:

- **Python 3.9+** (or your chosen template version).
- **Git**.
- **uv**: Our chosen dependency manager. Install it `officially`{uv-install-documentation}.
- **Docker or Podman**: If you plan to work with containers (most web apps will need this). Install `Docker`{docker-install-documentation} or `Podman`{podman-install-documentation}.

## 2. Create Your Project

Navigate to the directory you want to create your new project in.

```bash
cd ~/path/to/my/repos
```

Generate your project from the template using the given command:

```bash
uvx cookiecutter gh:56kyle/cookiecutter-robust-python
```

Follow the prompts to customize your project.

## 3. Initial Project Setup

Navigate to your new project directory:

```bash
cd your-project-slug
```

Install dependencies and create the virtual environment using `uv sync`:

```bash
uv sync
```

This command reads `pyproject.toml`, resolves dependencies from `uv.lock`, installs them into a standard virtual environment (`.venv` by default), and prepares the project.

## 4. Install Pre-commit Hooks

Set up automated checks that run before you commit code:

```bash
uvx nox -s pre-commit -- install
```

Now, `git commit` will automatically run code formatting and basic linting checks on staged files.

## 5. Run Checks and Tests

Execute the template's core quality checks and tests using `nox` from the project root:

```bash
uvx nox -s check   # Runs linters, type checker, security checks
uvx nox -s test    # Runs tests and coverage
uvx nox # Runs default tasks (often check and test)
```

These commands use the Task Automation layer defined in `noxfile.py` and ensure checks run correctly in isolated environments using your specified Python version.

## 6. Build Documentation

If you need to view the project's generated documentation locally:

```bash
uvx nox -s docs
```

This builds the project documentation website into the `docs/_build/html` directory.

## Next Steps

- Start writing your code in the `src/` directory!
- Add and remove dependencies using `uv add <package>` and `uv remove <package>`.
- If building a web application, explore the `Dockerfile` and `compose.yaml` ([Application Container Building](topics/11_container-build.md), [Container Orchestration](topics/15_compose-local.md)).
- Set up [CI](topics/13_ci-orchestration.md)/[CD](topics/14_cd-orchestration.md) using the example workflow files (e.g., in `.github/workflows/`).

For detailed information on any of these tools or workflows, navigate through the template's full documentation.
