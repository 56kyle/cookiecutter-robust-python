# Quickstart

This guide covers the essential steps to get up and running with a project generated by `cookiecutter-robust-python`. Perfect for developers who want to start coding with the core workflows immediately.

For detailed tool explanations and project philosophy, see the full documentation.

---

## 1. Prerequisites

Make sure you have these installed:

- **Python 3.9+** (or your chosen template version).
- **Git**.
- **uv**: Our chosen dependency manager. Install it {uv-install}`officially<>`.
- **Docker or Podman**: If you plan to work with containers (most web apps will need this). Install {docker-install}`Docker<>` or {podman-install}`Podman<>`.

## 2. Create Your Project

Navigate to the directory you want to create your new project in.

```bash
cd ~/path/to/my/repos
```

Generate your project from the template:

```bash
uvx cruft create https://github.com/56kyle/cookiecutter-robust-python.git
```

Follow the prompts to customize your project.

## 3. Initial Project Setup

Navigate to your new project directory:

```bash
cd your-project-slug
```

Set up the virtual environment and install dependencies:

```bash
uvx nox -s setup-venv
```

This sets up a virtual environment with uv and installs all development dependencies.

## 4. Install Pre-commit Hooks

Set up automated checks that run before you commit code:

```bash
uvx nox -s pre-commit -- install
```

Now, `git commit` will automatically run code formatting and basic linting checks on staged files.

## 5. Run Checks and Tests

Run quality checks and tests using the nox sessions:

```bash
uvx nox -s lint-python      # Run Ruff linting
uvx nox -s typecheck        # Run Pyright type checking
uvx nox -s security-python  # Run Bandit and pip-audit
uvx nox -s tests-python     # Run pytest with coverage
```

These commands run in isolated environments with the proper Python versions as defined in `noxfile.py`.

## 6. Build Documentation

Build and serve the project documentation locally:

```bash
uvx nox -s docs           # Build and serve with live reload
uvx nox -s build-docs     # Build only (static files)
```

The `docs` session builds and serves documentation with automatic reload on changes.

## Next Steps

- Start writing your code in the `src/` directory!
- Add and remove dependencies using `uv add <package>` and `uv remove <package>`.
- If building a web application, explore the `Dockerfile` and `compose.yaml` ([Application Container Building](topics/11_container-build.md), [Container Orchestration](topics/15_compose-local.md)).
- Set up [CI](topics/13_ci-orchestration.md)/[CD](topics/14_cd-orchestration.md) using the example workflow files (e.g., in `.github/workflows/`).

For detailed information on any of these tools or workflows, navigate through the template's full documentation.
