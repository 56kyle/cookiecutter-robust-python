# cookiecutter-robust-python Template Documentation

Welcome to the comprehensive documentation for the `cookiecutter-robust-python` project template.

This template provides a **robust, opinionated, and modern** starting point for Python projects, emphasizing code quality, automated workflows, multi-OS compatibility, and best-practice tooling.

This documentation explains the **rationale behind the template's design and tool choices**, serving as a detailed technical log and guide for those using or contributing to the template.

## Navigating This Documentation

This documentation is structured to guide you through the template's core philosophy, the decision process for selecting its tools, how those tools are integrated, and how to maintain the template itself.

## Building Project Documentation

**Note:** The documentation you are reading _is for the template itself_. A project generated by this template will have its _own_ separate `docs/` directory for its project-specific documentation (API reference, tutorials, etc.).

The generated project's documentation also uses {sphinx}`Sphinx<>` with MyST Markdown and integrates API documentation via `autodoc`. You can build your project's documentation by navigating into the generated project directory and running:

```bash
uvx nox -s docs
```

(Ensure you have followed the initial setup steps in your generated project's `README.md` or `docs/` directory to install project development dependencies first).
